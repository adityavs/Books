Comment: What can I say about this book? Be prepared to cry, and take a huge leap into the depths of who you are as a person. It got a little too new-age in few parts for my taste, but it is a truly beautiful book.

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Comment: The first 80% of this book is practical advice on tidying. The last 20% is the reason this book got five stars. Deeply thoughtful advice on why owning things only things that bring you joy opens up your life to be lived the way it was meant to.

#### 6. [Let Your Life Speak - Parker J. Palmer](http://letyourlifespeak.com)

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Worth Reading: 👋🏻

Comment: This book doesn't really have much in the way of practical advice for tuning into your interests. There are a few nuggets of wisdom, but it's mostly just the author's story.

#### 7. [Originals - Adam Grant](http://www.adamgrant.net/#!originals/c1ckh)

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Worth Reading: 👋🏻

Comment: This book has an interesting premise, but it's delivered with very little personality. It's nearly just fact recitation. Skip this unless you're writing a research paper on the topic.

Comment: Very surface level book. Mostly just stories about other people's travels. Skip this one unless that topic really interests you.

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Worth Reading: 👍🏻

Comment: This book really did help me discover what kind of work is right for me. It provided the understanding that finding the job that that compliments your interests and skills is a journey, and you can alter the course of that journey at any time. I would have liked a little more analysis instead of other people's stories, but this is still a great book.

#### 12. [Seven Brief Lessons on Physics - Carlo Rovelli](http://www.sevenbrieflessons.com/)

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Comment: Very beautiful discussion of physics and our place in the world. I enjoyed this incredibly brief (88 pages!) book. Though, there were a few parts where the language felt unnecessarily complicated.
