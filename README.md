Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️️️️⭐️

Worth Reading: 👍🏻

Comment: This is the book that taught me how to have a morning routine. It changed my life. It does have a bit too much marketing in it though.

#### 4. [True Refuge - Tara Brach](https://www.tarabrach.com/books-cds/)

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Worth Reading: 👍🏻

Comment: What can I say about this book? Be prepared to cry, and take a huge leap into the depths of who you are as a person. It got a little too new-age in few parts for my taste, but it is a truly beautiful book.

#### 5. [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up - Marie Kondo](http://www.tidyingup.com)

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Worth Reading: 👍🏻

Comment: The first 80% of this book is practical advice on tidying. The last 20% is the reason this book got five stars. Deeply thoughtful advice on why owning things only things that bring you joy opens up your life to be lived the way it was meant to.

#### 6. [Let Your Life Speak - Parker J. Palmer](http://letyourlifespeak.com)

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Worth Reading: 👋🏻

Comment: This book doesn't really have much in the way of practical advice for tuning into your interests. There are a few nuggets of wisdom, but it's mostly just the author's story.

#### 7. [Originals - Adam Grant](http://www.adamgrant.net/#!originals/c1ckh)

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Worth Reading: 👋🏻

Comment: This book has an interesting premise, but it's delivered with very little personality. It's nearly just fact recitation. Skip this unless you're writing a research paper on the topic.

#### 8. [The Personal MBA - Josh Kaufman](https://personalmba.com)

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Worth Reading: 👍🏻

Comment: Absolutely stuffed with incredible advice and beautifully explained ideas. I'm holding on to this one to read again.

#### 9. [The Happiness of Pursuit - Chris Guillebeau](http://chrisguillebeau.com/books/)

Rating: ⭐️⭐️

Worth Reading: 👎🏻

Comment: Very surface level book. Mostly just stories about other people's travels. Skip this one unless that topic really interests you.
